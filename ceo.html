<p><div class="raar">Teamwork is working in a group of two and more people to achieve a common goal. Teamwork builds your identity and gives you purpose. It helps you set clear goals and work towards them in a group. The problem with working alone is you can get easily derailed or demotivated. But you are more likely to succeed when you work as a team. Teamwork is important in life because it is involved in every aspect of work, studies, and relationships. People with good teamwork skills find it easier to make progress and enjoy many benefits.</p>
<p>“We expect all of our employees to remain focused and continue striving towards our goals. The Executive Leadership Team is here to provide support and guidance.”
    As we look ahead, it’s important to stay diligent and committed to our objectives. Let’s keep working together towards success!”
    “We need everyone to remain focused on the tasks at hand in order for us to reach our goals. The Executive Leadership Team is here to provide support and guidance.”</p>
    
    <p>Each year I make it a priority to write to you on behalf of BlackRock’s clients, who are shareholders in your company. The majority of our clients are investing to finance retirement. Their time horizons can span decades.

        The financial security we seek to help our clients achieve is not created overnight. It is a long-term endeavor, and we take a long-term approach. That is why, for the past decade, I have written to you, as CEOs and Chairs of the companies our clients are invested in. I write these letters as a fiduciary for our clients who entrust us to manage their assets – to highlight the themes that I believe are vital to driving durable long-term returns and to helping them reach their goals.
        
        When my partners and I founded BlackRock as a startup 34 years ago, I had no experience running a company. Over the past three decades, I’ve had the opportunity to talk with countless CEOs and to learn what distinguishes truly great companies. Time and again, what they all share is that they have a clear sense of purpose; consistent values; and, crucially, they recognize the importance of engaging with and delivering for their key stakeholders. This is the foundation of stakeholder capitalism.
        
        Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not “woke.” It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper. This is the power of capitalism. </div></p>
