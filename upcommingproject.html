            <h1>PROJECT NAME: <strong>ONLINE AUCTION SYSTEM</strong></h1>
        
            <h1> DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:       <br> <br>   <i>   The online auction allows the users to procure the benefits of the auction from any geographical location. The sellers can showcase their products or services to buyers across the locations. This helps in wider reachability and a huge expansion of the business. 

                Another useful feature of online auctions is the instant feedback feature that allows the bidders to track the price increase due to higher bidding. 
                
                The bidders or buyers from across the globe can log in at any time of the day to track or bid. This way they do not lose out on the opportunity due to different geographical timelines.
                
                In an online auction, buyers and sellers engage in transactional business, wherein buyers purchase items through price bidding. Here, the bids have a starting price and an ending time. Potential buyers who place the highest bidding price for an item are declared the winners and owners of particular items. 
                
                In this project, you will create a secure online auction system using the fraud detection method with binary classification. If a user wants to buy a product through an online auction, they must provide their identification details like PAN number, email address, license number, etc. The system will then screen the users, authenticate, and authorize them. Only authorized users can bid in the auction. The system will be designed to predict fraudulent users in the early stages, thereby eliminating the risk of online fraud and scams. These beginner-level computer science projects will help build a strong foundation for fundamental programming concepts.</h1><br></i>

	      <h1>PROJECT NAME:     FACE DETECTION </h1>
            <br>
            <h1> DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:       <br><br><i> It is of high importance and it serves various purposes in many fields. Most importantly, the technology of face detection has increased the surveillance efforts of the authorities. 

Face detection coupled with the technology of biometrics and security has helped to identify people’s faces which has resulted in various processes such as starting an app, security, or guiding what the next action steps of the application would be.

The technology of face detection uses facial algorithms to identify the reach of facial prints. The technology can adapt and recognize which facial features to detect and which ones to ignore.

One of the best ideas to start experimenting with your hands-on computer science projects for students is face detection software. This project focuses on building face detection software using the OpenCV library. The face detection program will be modeled in a way that it can detect faces in live stream videos from a webcam or video files stored in a PC’s local storage. The software uses pre-trained XML classifiers to detect faces in real time and track them. You can also use different classifiers to identify various objects through this detection program.

To run this program, you need to install the OpenCV library on your local machine. Also, it would be best if you created appropriate paths for the XML classifier files before executing the program.   </h1><br></i>

<h1>PROJECT NAME:     ANDROID BATTERY SAVER SYSTEM </h1>
       
            <h1> DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:       <br><br><i> The battery saver project is useful for the users to track the usage of the application. The users can track which of the applications are consuming the maximum energy. 

This way the users can optimize their application management. The optimization of the application can limit the application usage, and this end up limiting the battery. 

The battery saver in the mobile phone would also allow the users to procure the list of applications in one place, the consumption rate is also accurate. 

This is of a simple computer science project yet an exciting one. The Android battery saver is designed to analyze the battery usage data from built-in classes and create a consolidated list of apps that drain the power of the Android phone. The system can also determine the battery level of the phone. In situations where the battery level is low, and numerous apps are consuming too much power, this system will trigger an alarm telling the user to force stop or close the apps that are drawing power.

While the battery saver system has no backend, it uses Android Studio as the frontend. Since the system feeds on data from an Android phone, it does not need a backend framework. The primary aim of this battery saver system is to notify users of the apps that are high on power consumption, thereby allowing them to take specific actions to stop battery drainage.  </h1><br></i>
